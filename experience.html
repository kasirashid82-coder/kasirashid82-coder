            <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>Two experiences taught me about control in sales.</p>

                <h2>LeanWorksOy: The Problem I Couldn't Solve</h2>
                <p>Four months of d2d. Mid-ticket products.</p>
                <p>I could set the frame well—31% retention rate proved that.</p>
                <p>But whenever clients hit me with resistance ("Why should I go with you?"), I lost control.</p>
                <p>I'd justify—features, benefits, price. The more I explained, the more they pushed back.</p>
                <p>I knew something was wrong, but I didn't have the answer yet.</p>

                <h2>National Sales Competition: Figuring It Out Under Pressure</h2>
                <p>Semi-finals. Taitaja2026 Keski-Uusimaa. Selling sports products—protein bars, drinks, electrolyte tablets.</p>
                <p>I learned the redirect in the last practice before competition: whoever asks controls. Whoever answers reacts.</p>
                <p>Mid-pitch, I tested it:</p>
                <p><strong>Me:</strong> "Can I ask, do you do sports?"<br>
                <strong>Client:</strong> "I don't do sports."</p>
                <p>Most salespeople justify here. I redirected: "That's okay, but do you notice your energy levels drop during the day?"</p>
                <p>The conversation shifted. They started talking about their problem. I was leading.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> 89.55/100 in the semi-finals.</p>
                <p>That's when I understood: questions create control. Justification loses it.</p>
