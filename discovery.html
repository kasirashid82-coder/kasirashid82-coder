                <h2>I'm learning in real time. Here's what's working.</h2>

                <h3>Interactions are never neutral</h3>
                <p>Someone is always setting the rules, whether consciously or unconsciously.</p>
                <p>In sales it's apparent—clients decide from the start. Crossed arms, suspicious attitude.</p>
                <p>I lost many deals because I didn't direct the interaction.</p>                
                <p>Once I started setting the frame, I stopped convincing and started selling.</p>
                <p>It's like chess: White moves first and controls the tempo.</p>
                <p>In conversations, the person who sets the tone has the same advantage. Take the first move.</p>

                <h3>What if someone else has control over the tempo?</h3>
                <p><strong>HOT POTATO METHOD:</strong></p>
                <p>Whoever asks controls. Whoever answers reacts. </p>
                <p>I lost dozens of sales at Leanworks before I figured this out. </p>
                 <p>Every time I answered their question, I gave them the power to walk away</p>
                <p>When someone puts you on defense ("Why should I go with you?"), redirect with a question ("What are you looking for?").</p>
                <p>The pressure returns to them. You regain control.</p>

                <h3>Complexity isn't intelligence. It's insecurity.</h3>
                <p>The more complex the message, the heavier the cognitive load.</p>
                <p>I move from topics to another pretty fast, and for me things do click.</p>
                <p>Because of this, conversations dragged longer than they should've.</p>
                <p>Giving people more reason to decline.</p>
                <p>Simplicity beats sounding smart.</p>
                <p>Simple doesn't mean stupid—it means understood.</p>
                <p>A message no one understands is useless.</p>
